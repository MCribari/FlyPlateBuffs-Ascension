# FlyPlateBuffs for Ascension Bronzebeard/Malfurion.

**->** flyPlateBuffs displays buffs/debuffs above nameplates.
**->** Seatch PAB in addons tab to set up the addon.
**->** Upgraded version of the addon "PlateBuffs".

### Features:
- It can show specific spells bigger than others.
- There's predefined list, which contains some defensive and burst buffs, and crowd control debuffs. You can edit this list.
- Two modes of duration display (on and under icon).
- Many others display options.
- I was inspired by abandoned PlateBuffs and make this addon mostly looking like original.
